i'm athreya, also known as phytes or cockgod398. (not real)
my personal interests/workflow revolve purely around aesthetics and conveniency, tilted to a very slight degree of "productivity" (whihc is why im settugn up lixnu) (so uniqie and qiruky!!)
- as of 10/18/23, my interests lie primarily in learning linux (currently setting-up pop! and nobara systems, may use arch in the future) 
- i do also want to learn css/html to create and design websites for blogs and clothing brands. (be tuned for my% release!!)
- - potential side-interests at the ripe age of 16 for me are copywriting and remote sales rep (???) cus im too lazy for a job haha

= outside of the code stuff, i go gym and cry.
= and i watch a bit of anime and play games rarely.
